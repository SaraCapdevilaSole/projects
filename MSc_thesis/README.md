# Source code for MSc Project:

This repository contains the source code developed for my MSc project, on 'Brain Function Modelling with Physics-Informed Neural Networks'

The key components of the project are outlined below:

## Contents:
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Scripts for data preprocessing, visualisation, statistical analysis and plotting.
   
2. **Finite Element Method (FEM) using Firedrake**:
   - Implementation of FEM simulations using Firedrake.
   - Includes problem setup, mesh generation, and solver configuration.

3. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**:
   - Code for training and evaluating PINNs to solve partial differential equations.
   - Builds on source code from PirateNets [1] (their source code should be first cloned and the files in this repository should be added to their /examples).
